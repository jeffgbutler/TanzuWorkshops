# Basic Microservice with .Net Core 3.x

This exercise will cover the following:

- Building a simple web service with .Net core
- Deploying the service to PCF
- Using Steeltoe to bind to a redis cloud instance
- Doing a blue/green deployment with PCF

## Pre-Requisites

### .Net Core

1. Install the .Net core SDK from this URL: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download
1. Verify the install by opening a terminal or command window and typing `dotnet --version`. You should see a version string to match the version you installed

### Install an IDE

1. Install either Visual Studio IDE or Visual Studio Code from this URL: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/
1. If you choose Visual Studio Code, also install the C# extension

## Build a Simple Web Service

### Create the Basic Project

1. Create a basic web service project and open it in VS Code
   ```shell
   mkdir csharp-payment-calculator
   cd csharp-payment-calculator
   dotnet new webapi --no-https
   code .
   ```
1. Run the new web service with `dotnet run` (or just press F5 in Visual Studio/Code), then navigate to http://localhost:5000/WeatherForecast

1. Stop the service with `ctrl-c` (or press the stop button in Visual Studio/Code)

### Add a Payment Calculator

1. Create a new `Services` directory
1. Create a new class `PaymentService` in the `Services` directory, set its contents to the following:

   ```csharp
   using System;

   namespace PaymentCalculator.Services
   {
       public class PaymentService
       {
           public Decimal Calculate(double Amount, double Rate, int Years)
           {
               if (Rate == 0.0)
               {
                   return CalculateWithoutInterest(Amount, Years);
               }
               else
               {
                   return CalculateWithInterest(Amount, Rate, Years);
               }
           }

           private Decimal CalculateWithInterest(double Amount, double Rate, int Years)
           {
               double monthlyRate = Rate / 100.0 / 12.0;
               int numberOfPayments = Years * 12;
               double payment = (monthlyRate * Amount) / (1.0 - Math.Pow(1.0 + monthlyRate,
                   -numberOfPayments));
               return ToMoney(payment);
           }

           private Decimal CalculateWithoutInterest(double Amount, int Years)
           {
               int numberOfPayments = Years * 12;
               return ToMoney(Amount / numberOfPayments);
           }

           private Decimal ToMoney(double d)
           {
               Decimal bd = new Decimal(d);
               return Decimal.Round(bd, 2, MidpointRounding.AwayFromZero);
           }
       }
   }
   ```

### Add a Hit Counter

1. Create a new interface `IHitCounterService` in the `Services` directory, set its contents to the following:

   ```csharp
   namespace PaymentCalculator.Services
   {
       public interface IHitCounterService
       {
           long GetAndIncrement();
           void Reset();
       }
   }
   ```

1. Create a new Class `MemoryHitCounterService` in the `Services` directory, set its contents to the following:

   ```csharp
   namespace PaymentCalculator.Services
   {
       public class MemoryHitCounterService: IHitCounterService
       {
           private long HitCount = 0;
           public long GetAndIncrement()
           {
               return ++HitCount;
           }

           public void Reset()
           {
               HitCount = 0;
           }
       }
   }
   ```

### Add a Crash Service

Create a new Class `CrashService` in the `Services` directory, set its contents to the following:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

namespace PaymentCalculator.Services
{
    public class CrashService
    {
        public void CrashIt()
        {
            // ends the app after a 2 second delay
            Task.Run(async delegate
            {
                await Task.Delay(2000);
                Environment.Exit(22);
            });
        }
    }
}
```

### Add a Basic Domain Object

1. Create a new `Models` directory
1. Create a new class `CalculatedPayment` in the `Models` directory, set its contents to the following:

   ```csharp
   namespace PaymentCalculator.Models
   {
       public class CalculatedPayment
       {
           public double Amount {get; set;}
           public double Rate {get; set;}
           public int Years {get; set;}
           public decimal Payment {get; set;}
           public string Instance {get; set;}
           public long Count {get; set;}
       }
   }
   ```

### Create a REST Controller for the Payment Service

Create a new class `PaymentController` in the `Controllers` directory, set its contents to the following:

```csharp
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;
using PaymentCalculator.Models;
using PaymentCalculator.Services;

namespace PaymentCalculator.Controllers
{
    [Route("/[controller]")]
    [ApiController]
    public class PaymentController
    {
        private PaymentService PaymentService;
        private IHitCounterService HitCounterService;

        private readonly ILogger _logger;

        public PaymentController(PaymentService paymentService,
                IHitCounterService hitCounterService,
                ILogger<PaymentController> logger)
        {
            PaymentService = paymentService;
            HitCounterService = hitCounterService;
            _logger = logger;
        }

        [HttpGet]
        public ActionResult<CalculatedPayment> calculatePayment(double Amount, double Rate, int Years)
        {
            var Payment = PaymentService.Calculate(Amount, Rate, Years);

            _logger.LogDebug("Calculated payment of {Payment} for input amount: {Amount}, rate: {Rate}, years: {Years}",
                Payment, Amount, Rate, Years);

            return new CalculatedPayment
            {
                Amount = Amount,
                Rate = Rate,
                Years = Years,
                Instance = "local",
                Count = HitCounterService.GetAndIncrement(),
                Payment = Payment
            };
        }
    }
}
```

### Create a REST Controller for the Hit Count Reset Service

Create a new class `ResetCountController` in the `Controllers` directory, set its contents to the following:

```csharp
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using PaymentCalculator.Services;

namespace PaymentCalculator.Controllers
{
    [Route("/[controller]")]
    [ApiController]
    public class ResetCountController
    {
        private IHitCounterService HitCounterService;

        public ResetCountController(IHitCounterService hitCounterService)
        {
            HitCounterService = hitCounterService;
        }

        [HttpGet]
        public ActionResult<string> ResetCount()
        {
            HitCounterService.Reset();
            return "OK";
        }
    }
}
```

### Create a REST Controller for the Crash Service

Create a new class `CrashController` in the `Controllers` directory, set its contents to the following:

```csharp
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using PaymentCalculator.Services;

namespace PaymentCalculator.Controllers
{
    [Route("/[controller]")]
    [ApiController]
    public class CrashController
    {
        private CrashService CrashService;
        public CrashController(CrashService crashService)
        {
            CrashService = crashService;
        }

        /// <summary>
        /// Warning! Executing this API will crash the application.
        /// </summary>
        [HttpGet]
        public ActionResult<string> CrashIt()
        {
            CrashService.CrashIt();
            return "OK";
        }
    }
}
```

### Setup Dependency Injection and the MVC Pipeline

1. Modify `Startup.cs` by adding the following lines at the end of the `ConfigureServices` method:

   ```csharp
   services.AddCors();
   services.AddOptions();
   services.AddSingleton<PaymentService>();
   services.AddSingleton<CrashService>();
   services.AddSingleton<IHitCounterService, MemoryHitCounterService>();
   ```

1. Modify `Startup.cs` by adding the following line in the `Configure` method prior to the existing line `app.UseRouting();`:

   ```csharp
   app.UseCors(builder => builder.AllowAnyOrigin());
   ```

1. Start the application either with the debugger (F5), or by entering the command `dotnet run`

1. Try the web service with the URL http://localhost:5000/payment?amount=100000&rate=4.5&years=30

1. Verify that a payment of \$506.69 is returned

## Add Swagger

Swagger is a REST documentation and UI tool, that also includes code generation tools for clients. For us, it will act as a very simple and almost free UI for the web service we've just created. There are two implementations of swagger: Swashbuckle and NSwag. For this exercise, we will use Swashbuckle. 

Newer versions of DotNet automatically setup Swagger for new webapi projects. If swagger is already configured, you
can skip this section.

1. Modify `Startup.cs`, add the following to the end of the `ConfigureServices` method:

   ```csharp
   services.AddSwaggerGen(c =>
   {
       c.SwaggerDoc("v1", new OpenApiInfo { Title = "My API", Version = "v1" });
   });
   ```

1. Modify `Startup.cs`, add the following to the end of the `Configure` method:

   ```csharp
   app.UseSwagger();
   app.UseSwaggerUI(c =>
   {
       c.SwaggerEndpoint("/swagger/v1/swagger.json", "My API V1");
       c.RoutePrefix = string.Empty;
   });
   ```

1. Start the application. The swagger UI should now be available at the application root (http://localhost:5000)

1. Notice that Swagger has documented all web services - the services we wrote as well as the default service generated by dotnet. If you want, you can delete the generated web service by deleting `WeatherForecastController.cs` and `WeatherForecast.cs`
